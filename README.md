# The Mythboud Project

# Development

A "dev" branch will be created from the "main" branch. Subsequent branches will be created from the "dev" branch to manage different parts of the project:

* Website
* Web App (Bot Portal)
* Bot
* Database

## Feature Branches

Development will occur on individual features one at a time, each having its own branch created from its respective parent part.

Once the first part (Website) is completed, and all feature branches have been merged into their parent, the "website" branch will be merged into the "dev" branch. After merging all feature branches of the website part into their respective parent part, the website part of the project will be merged into the "dev" branch, marking the project's first alpha release.

When all parts of the project have been merged into the "development" branch, a new branch named "testing" will be created from the "development" branch, and the project will transition to its first beta release.

### Time Scale

I anticipate that this project will require most of 2024 to reach its first beta release.

# Future Updates

I will soon update this README with more detailed information about the project.
